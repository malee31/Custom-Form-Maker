# Testing Reading and Writing to a Google Sheet through Node.js
To run this, you'll need SpreadSheetCredentials.json (just a renamed Google Drive API Service account key json file from Google Developers Console) and a SpreadsheetID.json with nothing but an "id" key with the sheet ID.
The email given in the credentials json file must have edit access to the sheet being used for data too.

The json files are from my school email account and the spreadsheet is my Spreadsheet Playground sheet.
